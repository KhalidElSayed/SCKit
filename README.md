SCKit
=====

SCKit is a simple, unfocused Objective-C library. It is designed to potentially be useful to both iOS and OS X developers. Thus, it is not designed to be compiled into a single static library that can be shipped with your application. Instead, you should drag any source files that you wish to use directly into your project.
