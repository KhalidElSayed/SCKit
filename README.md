SCKit
=====

About
-----
SCKit is a simple, unfocused Objective-C library. It is designed to contain useful code for both iOS and OS X projects. Currently, it has a definite iOS bias, but that may change in the future.

Compatibility
-------------
SCKit is designed to work with iOS 4.0 or later, as well as OS X 10.6 or later.

Usage
-----
To use SCKit, add this repository as a submodule to your own and drag any files you wish to use into your Xcode project. Compiling SCKit as a static library to ship with your application is also possible, but is an exercise left to the user.
