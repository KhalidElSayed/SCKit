SCKit
=====

About
-----
SCKit is a simple, unfocused Objective-C library. It is designed to contain useful code for both iOS and OS X projects. Currently, it has a definite iOS bias, but that may change in the future.

Usage
-----
SCKit is not designed to be compiled into a static library that can be shipped with your application. Instead, you should drag any source files that you wish to use directly into your project.
